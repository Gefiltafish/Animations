# ninja-profiles

This project is a code assignment for 1337 to show my skills and to have fun while doing it. 
It was initiated with use-react-app.

## Tickets

* A modern design: I like it when things look neat. Some of the design like colors and shadows I borrowed from the already existing ninja-page
* No UI framework used: I've always enjoyed writing CSS, and even though something like Material-UI sure is nice, it always feels nice to write 
the styling yourself.
* Responsive design: I started with the "mobile first approach" and find it quite simple when working with flexbox.
* Filter by name and office: This one seemed reasonable to make and also a fun challenge (even though my solution is far from bug-free)
* Filter by contact links: See above ^
* End-to-end testing: For the last 3-4 months I've really started to enjoy working with cypress. It is smart, there's definitely a place for end-to-end testing and I enjoy watching the computer write in all the commands :D
